## How it started

I discovered the world of toy photography back in 2016 while listening to a french podcast called ["C'est cool ! C'est quoi ?"](https://vaisseauhypersensas.fr/cccq/1/1). I was immediately captivated by the concept of using toys as subjects in photography.

I had never considered toy photography as a legitimate form of art and always thought of toys as collectibles or relics from my childhood. However, **the podcast opened my eyes to a whole new world of creativity and possibility**.

As soon as the episode ended, I began to research the topic more thoroughly. I was amazed at the level of skill and dedication that went into creating these miniature scenes and capturing them on camera. I was also inspired by the incredible community of toy photographers who shared their work on Instagram.

Since that day, toy photography has been a passion of mine, and I'm always amazed at the incredible creativity and skill of the photographers who specialize in this niche. And as a toy photography enthusiast, I wanted to create a place for toy photographers to share their expertise and experiences.
