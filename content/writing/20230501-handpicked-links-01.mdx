_I spend a lot of time on internet, so here's what I've seen lately I think are worth sharing._

## Binge-watching

[Architectural Digest](https://www.youtube.com/@Archdigest/featured) — A Youtube channel that features the luxurious homes of celebrities. Devin Booker's gaming room is the only thing I dream about now.

[Making Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUkKSYcWvxI&ab_channel=Netflix) — Grumpy expert maker Jimmy DiResta fields kids' ideas for delightfully pointless inventions. The kind of job no one tells you about in highschool.

## AI Tools

[Speechify](https://speechify.com/) — An application that provides text-to-speech technology to help individuals with reading difficulties or disabilities to access and consume written content. The platform offers a simple and intuitive interface that enables users to upload any type of document, including eBooks, PDFs, and web pages, and convert them into spoken words. You can ask **Snoop Dogg** to read you the morning news. This a awesome.

[Opus Pro](https://www.opus.pro/) — A generative AI video tool that repurposes long videos into shorts in one click. The perfect tool for sharing someone else's content without permission on TikTok. Wonderfull isn't it?

[Markprompt](https://markprompt.com/) — A set of API endpoints that allow you to train your content and create a prompt to ask questions to it. For instance you can sync a Markdown/Markdoc/MDX/HTML files from a GitHub repository to create a docs site.
