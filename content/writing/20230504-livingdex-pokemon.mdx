A LivingDex is a complete collection of every single Pok√©mon that has ever been released, with at least one of each individual species.

## Requirements

- Nintendo Lite, DS or 3DS
- Nintendo Switch
- Nintendo Network
- Pokemon Bank
- Pokemon Home
- Pokemon games obviously

## Start at the beginning

I am embarking on my Pokemon adventure, beginning with the first generation on the Virtual Console for Nintendo 3DS and playing Pokemon Blue/Red. To ensure that I have all three starters and their evolutions, I will transfer Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle three times, resetting the game each time. I have two Nintendo DS devices - one for playing and another for trading Pokemon. Once this task is complete, I can begin my journey through Kanto.

There are several known glitches in Pokemon Red / Blue, some of which can be exploited to gain various advantages in the game. Here are a few of the most notable glitches:

- **The Mew Glitch** is another popular exploit that allows players to obtain the elusive Mew without attending official Pokemon events. Sadly, you can't transfer Mew to Pokemon Bank.
- **Item Duplication Glitch** allows players to duplicate any item in their inventory, like Master Balls and Rare Candies. Its not working on the french version of the game.
- **Trainer-Fly Glitch** involves exploiting the game's programming to bypass trainer battles and encounter Pokemon in areas that would otherwise be inaccessible. The most useful glitch in my case, I used [this map of all the different pokemon you can encounter](http://puu.sh/257S) using it.

Completing the game took me 60 hours, which may seem like a lot considering some players are able to achieve it in just 24 hours. However, I took my time and enjoyed every moment of the game, allowing myself to fully immerse in the experience as if I were 9 years old again.

I also spent a lot of time catching Pokemon and leveling them up, which is not necessary to complete the game but is something required for the LivingDex.

Kanto is done, I have all 151 Pokemon. I'm going to the next generation.

## What's next

## Point of view

Overall, creating a LivingDex is a fun and rewarding challenge for Pokemon fans who are looking to expand their knowledge and experience with the game. It requires dedication, patience, and a willingness to trade and communicate with other players.
