LeBron James, often regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, has had an illustrious career filled with incredible moments and achievements. In this project, I created an animated showcase of LeBron James' career using the powerful combination of [Curtains.js](https://github.com/martinlaxenaire/react-curtains), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=adwords&utm_campaign=TW-WW-All-GS-UA-Traffic-20190326-Brand.Bmm_&gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwz8emBhDrARIsANNJjS4B9Tavwk2at2Ul3zk-c4OhJ_tKuRh82AlNQpieMYlRfcm5SlcsQikaArchEALw_wcB) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/).

  ## Work in progress
  <Info label="I don't know when I will be able to finish this side project. But here is the roadmap if I find the time to finish it." />

The homepage is finished, there are the three teams of LeBron's career and the fancy animation of the slideshow.

The next step is to list all the epic moments of the career on video, mainly via Youtube. And reference them in an excel file. Next, I want to create an excel data import module in the project to create a feed for each team on the site.

**The idea is to be able to easily "clone" the project for another player.**

Stay tuned!
