Back in 2020, I started to play [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/fr/), a free-to-play action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo.

Like any self-respecting Genshin Impact enthusiast, I found myself immersed in the game's enchanting world, discovering hidden treasures, battling fearsome monsters, and, of course, relentlessly grinding for those elusive resources. As the hours ticked away, I realized I needed a tool to optimize my farming time and streamline my daily quests. And thus, the idea for [genshin.cool](https://genshin.cool/) was born.

## Multiple accounts support

For the seasoned Genshin Impact players among us — _yes, I'm looking at you, fellow collectors of waifus and husbandos_ — managing multiple accounts is practically a way of life. Fear not, my little project has got you covered. With its local storage, you can create and manage multiple profiles.

## Multilingual support

The web app has been translated into multiple languages with [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/), including French and English, to cater to players from various regions. Regardless of your preferred language, you can enjoy all the features and benefits of it, making it accessible to a wider community of players.

Hope you like it, see you later!
